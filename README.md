Subscription Entity Module Work Sample
==

* Create new entity in Magento 2 called Subscription, 
this entity should have fields: `id`, `name`, `description`, `date of subscription`.
It's up to you to decide which column types to use and indexes to add if necessary.

* The entity should have CRUD capabilities.

* Admin UI is not necessary but one should be able to create/read/update through either REST API or GraphQl (or both for extra bonus points).

* Try to follow Magento best practices and coding style guidelines.
